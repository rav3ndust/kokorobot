<h3>2024</h3>

<p>On April 22nd, Andrea, a friend, fellow sailor, and marina neighbor, passed away. Andrea was an excellent watercolor artist, specializing in dreamy scenery of the B.C. coast. We spent many afternoons on the dock, sharing stories, drinks in hand. Andrea was modest, soft-spoken and kind, she would always leave room for you in a conversation-a rare trait. There's a dark cloud hanging over the docks, it'll be a long while before it passes..</p>
