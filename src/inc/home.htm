<h2>2024-04-25 Kaizah</h2>

<p>I finished the {Hakum} sequence {Kaizah}. I'm pleased with the result! I also went over a lot of the comics in the {Hakum archive}, as I've said before they are no longer canon, but I did update some of the text anyway to bring them more in line. The handwritten text wasn't easy to read, so I updated all of them with the font I made(see {making a font}). I also published an older short sequence I had finished named {aftermath} that follows {night terror}, a short comic to show that Dae and Seir have a really difficult relationship.</p>

<p>I released a new <a href="../media/content/wunderland_13_full.jpg">Wunderland Rabbits</a> image. Spring is here on the West Coast of Canada, camas plants are in full bloom. We are getting ready to depart for northern waters, filling the boat with food, gathering e-books, etc.</p>

<p>Because I am learning {modern standard arabic} on the side, I've started keeping notes! I will append to this page as I go.</p>
