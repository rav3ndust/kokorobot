<h3>Tracking</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. This sequence takes place in the past, in the early days of the Solo D's. The ToT (Terror of the Taiga) has recently revealed himself to the group, to give them a hand so that they can monkeywrench safely. In this sequence, he is teaching its current members how to track and counter-track.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>
