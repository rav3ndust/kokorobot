        <li><b>Story</b>: {Mindbird}</li>

<p>Viktor entered {Cee}'s head a long time ago, he now lives there and won't be persuaded to leave. The bird is said to be the source of Cee's anxieties, a whisperer, and teller of fears and lies.</p>
<p>He questions everything, all the time, and makes a habit of overthinking every situation. Viktor thinks he can see bad things before they happen, and uses this to prevent Cee from taking risks, and from trying new things.</p>
<p>Viktor likes falafel, and the sound of rain as it falls onto Cee's skull.</p>
