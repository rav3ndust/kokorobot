<p>A useful slip-and-grip friction type hitch, which pulls tight when the load is applied and slides easily for re-placement when there is no load. It doesn't damage the rope it is tied to, and works well for ropes of different diameters.</p>

<p>The loop used to make this knot is terminated by a double fisherman's knot.</p>

<p>Note that the inventor of this knot, commonly referred to as a Prusik knot, was a lieutenant in the Nazi German Wehrmacht (I really had no idea until someone told me). It is unfortunate that this knot bears his last name.</p>
