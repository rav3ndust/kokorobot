<p>Adeka is feared by many who share {Cee}'s anxieties. She is a creature most fearsome, that draws you in when you're at your lowest of lows, and refuses to let go. It is possible to escape her grip, but not without losing something important. Adeka will stop at nothing to keep you in her world.</p>
