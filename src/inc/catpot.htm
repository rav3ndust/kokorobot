<p>Catpot is a small cooking game was made by myself and {Devine} over two days for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries' target='_blank'>Merveilles Hyperjam</a> in <b>April 2020</b>.</p>

<p>See the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOyQU0oRvs8' target='_blank'>Longplay video</a>(YouTube) of the game.</p>

<p>"Help Cat in the kitchen. Cat is hungry." We wanted to make a point and click cooking game. As the tagline suggests, Cat is hungry, so the goal is to help Cat fetch ingredients from different places to make a full meal which consists of a miso soup, some rice and some tsukemono(pickled vegetables). BUT, you've got to pick ingredients in the right order... while helping residents of the TeaPot house with some of their problems.</p>

<p>This jam was to teach people how to use Hypercard, a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers by Bill Atkinson. Find out <a href='https://cancel.fm/hyperjam/' target='_blank'>how to emulate a Macintosh II</a>.</p>

<p>We made this game jam while in Japan, not long before our <a href='busydoingnothing.html'>crossing of the Pacific Ocean</a>. Many participants were in lockdown in their homes because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Drawing in Hypercard is actually really great? I had a lot of fun with this.</p>
