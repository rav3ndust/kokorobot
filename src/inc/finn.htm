    <li><b>Name</b>: Finn</li>
    <li><b>Story</b>: {Mindbird}</li>
    <li><b>Appearance</b>: Small, round ears and eyes always closed, always in thought. Finn's tail is crooked and split in two.</li>
    <li><b>Relation</b>: Occasional visitor, and guest of {Viktor}</li>
</ul>

<p>Finn is a mouse, and infrequent guest inside {Cee}'s head. She likes to visit the bird {Viktor}, fascinated by all that plagues him. They spend entire evenings together, talking about the future and the science of bread.</p>

<p>It is said that after Finn was hit by lightning, her tail split in two and she became immortal. No one if this is true, but Finn makes a point of mentionning it everytime she visits. Finn is inquisitive, wise and has some strange ideas about life, which {Viktor} and her argue about for hours, over cups of peppermint tea.</p>
