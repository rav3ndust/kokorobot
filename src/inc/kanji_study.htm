<p>An Android app for looking up kanji with self-organized sets for convenient studying and quizzing.</p>

<p>See the app <a href='https://mindtwisted.com/index.html' target='_blank'>here</a>. I collaborated with Chase to make tanuki to represent each level. Interestingly enough, I met Chase when I lived in {Japan}, he was working with {Devine} for the language-learning app <b>iKnow!</b>. Since then Chase has left the company, and is now spending all of his time making Kanji Study!</p>

<p>Below are the sketches. Everytime a player successfully passes a lesson, the tanuki grows up, until it becomes old and wise. As it ages, the flower on its head blooms into a tree.</p>

<p>Because the app has a dark mode, we decided to make 'dark mode' tanuki too! The shading is a sort of digital pointillism, in the style of my {vancouver island mushrooms} series.</p>
