<h3>Meds</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. {Hakazi}(uses the name Yegon now) has been on his own for a while in Montore after leaving the Solo Devs(yet again), following a fight with {Ikkard} and {Kaddali}. His symptoms are getting worse, he can no longer control his outbursts. To try and limit the damage he causes, he visits a clinic in Montore (owned by {Jak} and {Nemerald}) to try and get some meds.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p>Jak's second language is m√†koua(French dialect), this explains why he doesn't pronounce certain words correctly (dis, dat instead this, that).</p>

<p><b>Content Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing.</i></p>
