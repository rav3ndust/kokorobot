<p>My bike is a fixed gear Specialized Langster road bike.</p>

<p>It has traveled far with me. I crossed an ocean with it aboard {Pino}. I've cycled with it in {Japan}, the US West Coast, Mexico, Cook Islands(I cycled around Rarotonga), New Zealand, and Fiji. The bike could have seen more roads, but not all ports had good and safe roads.</p>

<p><b>Does the bike rust at sea?</b> No, my bike doesn't rust, the frame is aluminum and I keep the steel chain and hub well-oiled(3 in 1 oil).</p>

<p><b>Where do you keep your bike?</b>. When in port for a long time, I keep it outside, locked to a strong point on the boat. When I move the boat, or during the winter/rainy season, I stow it inside. I stow the bikes inside in either the v-berth, or quarter berth. The best way to stow it is to take both wheels off, to remove the pedals, turn the handle bars sideways, and to tie all components with straps. I cover the bikes with a bike bag.</p>

<p>The bag is nothing special, but allowed us to carry them with us aboard trains while in Japan.</p>
