ChaCha's underside has tentacles that twist and turn with incredible speed, pushing the air to propel itself forward.</p>

<p>As a young Lepori, Lun-di developed an interest for racing because of <b>Encela</b>, grandparent and racer extraordinaire. Xe developed a great dislike for the <b>IFS</b> (interplanetary federation of ships), because of their affluence and rigidity. After Encela was forcibly removed from the <b>Belt Championship</b> for using a non-authorized style of ship, Lun-di set out to form xem own league, a group of racers dedicated not to form or rules, but to speed and accessibility.</p>
