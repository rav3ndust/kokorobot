<p>Merure was a comic anthology published by MachineMachine(no longer operating) and sold by {Drownspire}. MachineMachine was a non-profit collective created by myself, {Devine}, Vincent Desbiens, and Michael Verhaaf. The extra money was used to pay off the publishing fees of the next books, and to pay for tables at local comic events like Expozine. As MachineMachine, we published 3 full-color volumes from 2008 to 2010, with short comics by 10-15 artists from Montreal.</p>

<p>Each participant had three months to come up with a concept, from thumbnail sketches to final product, without thematic or technical constraints, while juggling with their professional or student lives. The result was a myriad of styles and ideas which made others discover an ecclectic side to the underground comic arts.</p>
