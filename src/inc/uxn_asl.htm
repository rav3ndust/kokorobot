<p>The {Uxn} documentation includes hand gestures which we believe might serve a dual purpose, making the Uxntal language as a system that can be used outside of a computer for general computing arithmetic, as well as to help students to familiarize themselves with hexadecimal finger-counting and bitwise operations. The system uses a few existing gestures from ASL, and purposefully creates new gestures to disambiguate others.</p>

<p>Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Uxn gestures differenciate from traditional ASL numbers which are used only in the names of, and references to, labels.</p>

<p>We worked on this project while waiting for good weather to cross the Strait of Georgia from Nanaimo to Secret Cove on May 27-28th 2022.</p>

<p>I drew these by hand, inked them by hand, photographed them and cleaned them up in Gimp.</p>
