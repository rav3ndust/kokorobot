<p>Adélie, or Adé, is a strong, and tall Eigata that can take the appearances of others. She is one of the only ancients active in the Montore Hegata community, having chosen to leave the Taiga many years ago.</p>

<p>She is a genial and kind being. She has much love for humans and is liked by all that she meets. Because she gets to see life through the eyes of many she has grown wise, many turn to her for advice... although she is reluctant to give it, because she feels that words are often not enough. Adé prefers to let others make their own mistakes, and also, she doesn't like to speak English.</p>
