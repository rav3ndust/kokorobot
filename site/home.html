<p>My website now has a splash page! Hovering the cursor over characters reveals little speech bubbles, it's possible to click on those and it'll take you somewhere on this site. If ever clicking/hovering on the image doesn't occur to people, I also added a re-direct that kicks in after 10 seconds.</p>

<p>I am still working on the new comic sequence for <a href='hakum.html' class='local'>hakum</a>. Unlike previous releases, where I would publish pages as I finished them, I will publish them all at once. Here is a <a href="../media/content/hakum_preview_240404.jpg" target="_blank">sneak peek</a>.</p>

<p>A few months ago I bought some mochigome(sticky Japanese rice) with the goal of learning how to make mochi. It took me a long time to try because I wasn't sure it was possible to do by hand on the boat. Most tutorials require the use of powered appliances. I've seen Japanese do it by hand by rapidly beating the dough with a mallet, I knew I couldn't do exactly that, but I had a pestle. I cooked the rice, transferred the rice to a bowl, crushed the rice with a potato masher, then went to work beating the dough using my pestle. It's hard work, it took me around 15 minutes of constant beating to get it to a sticky, cohesive mass. Then, I used plenty of cornstarch to separate the dough into 10 balls. Devine & I later cooked the balls with roasted sesame oil in a pan. The result was rice cakes that were crunchy on the outside, and soft and sticky on the inside. We'll make mochi again for sure, maybe next time we'll try to stuff the sticky dough with sweet red beans(anko). See <a href="../media/content/galley_experiment_mochi.jpg" target="_blank">the result</a>.</p>

<p>I made another small <a href="../site/rope_mats.html">rope mat</a> for <a href='pino.html' class='local'>pino</a> earlier this month. The <a href="../media/content/ropemats_blackrug.jpg">little black mat</a> was even featured in the latest hundredrabbits <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/videos/march_2024.jpg" target="_blank">newsletter</a>(without the flemish coil). If you're wondering what Little Ninj is doing in the image, he is trying to flatten the mat. When a new mat is finished it won't be comfortable to step on because the ropes are still round, but if the mat is set on the floor, time and the passing of feet will flatten it out. Stamping on a mat repeatedly is a quick way to flatten it, it's also possible to use a rubber mallet. Generally, we tolerate the initial discomfort and wait for the material to settle on its own.</p>

<p>In the interest of conserving useful articles about boating/sailing, I mirrored two articles on my website: <a href='defensive_boating.html' class='local'>defensive boating</a> and <a href='gunwale_and_hull_cushioning.html' class='local'>gunwale and hull cushioning</a>.</p>
